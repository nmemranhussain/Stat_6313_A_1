# Advanced Logistic Regression Analysis of Age-Based Participation Using R

The GitHub repository "flixit-data-analysis" houses the R code for performing logistic regression analysis on a dataset named "FlixIt_2025". This repository includes scripts for loading necessary libraries like dplyr, pscl, pROC, and ResourceSelection, and for processing the dataset for statistical analysis. The primary focus of the analysis is to explore the relationship between 'Age' and 'Participation' using logistic regression, generating insights such as coefficients, odds ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Additional calculations in the analysis cover McFadden's RÂ², area under the ROC curve, and model goodness-of-fit via the Hosmer and Lemeshow test. This codebase is useful for researchers or analysts interested in understanding the application of logistic regression in R, particularly in the context of binary outcome data related to age demographics. The README provides a comprehensive overview of how to set up the environment, execute the scripts, and interpret the results.
